## 📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **please do NOT create a public GitHub issue.**  
Instead, contact the project maintainers privately:

📩 **Email:** security-team@nexus.dev *(placeholder)*  
📞 **WhatsApp (Maintainer):** +256 787 029375 *(optional communication)*  

When reporting, include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Possible impact  
- Any recommended fix ideas  
- Your GitHub username (optional)  

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.

## ⏳ Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure process:

1. You report the vulnerability privately  
2. We investigate and confirm  
3. We prepare a fix  
4. We release a patch  
5. Only then is the issue publicly disclosed (optional)

## 🛡 Supported Versions

We provide security updates ONLY for:

- The latest **main** branch  
- The latest **stable release** (when available)

Older versions or forks are not officially supported.

## ❌ Do Not Report These as Security Issues

Please use regular GitHub Issues for:

- Typos or documentation errors  
- Broken demo apps  
- Design or architecture feedback  
- Missing features  
- Docker Compose errors  

These are **not** security vulnerabilities.
